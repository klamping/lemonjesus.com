    <p>"Where could we get enough lemons in this remote place to feed such a crowd?"</p>

    <p>"How many lemons do you have?" Jesus asked.</p>

    <p>"Seven," they replied, "and a few limes."</p>

    <p>"Jesus told the crowd to sit down on the ground. Then he took the seven lemons and the lime, and when he had given thanks, he cut them and gave them to the disciples, and they in turn to the people. They all ate and were satisfied. Afterward the disciples picked up seven basketfuls of broken pieces that were left over. The number of those who ate was four thousand men, besides women and children. After Jesus had sent the crowd away, he got into the boat and went to the vicinity of Magadan (or Magdala)."</p>
